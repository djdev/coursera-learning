My lab works on Coursera, all secured with passwords.

Coursera has an honor code, requesting that you should never make any content of your homework publicly available.
So I'd lock mines up with passwords in archives.

It's for backup, not sharing.

## Finished Courses

### Algorithms Part I

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/">Princeton University</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome">Algorithms, Part I | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: Apr 2, 2017
<li>Grade: 98.6/100
<li>Topic: ata structure, algorithm, Java
<li>Review: The lecture speed was <b>a bit too slow</b>, so I had to go at between 1.25x and 1.5x speed to save time. Everything is really well explained, making this course <b>very friendly even for fresh beginners</b>. Actually I signed up for this just to do a little practice in Java programming. Considering the ammount of work devoted to the programming assignments, it was a wise decision to join up, well worth the time and efforts.
</ul>

### Machine Learning

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome">Machine Learning | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: Apr 29, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: machine learning, Matlab
<li>Review: This is one of the "founding courses" of Coursera, thus it is supposed to be <b>easy and interesting</b> (otherwise people would've been scared off in the first place). So it is vital, for every programming assignment, that you try to <b>read and understand the 99% of codes already written for you</b>. The 1% for you to finish is really the trivial part. Otherwise there'll be no gain at all. Also it's fresh experience for those who get to <b>think in a vectorized manner</b> for the first time.

### Functional Programming Principles in Scala

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/home/welcome">Functional Programming Principles in Scala | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: May 10, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: functional programming, Scala
<li>Review: A course to learn Scala as well as functional programming. I'm a freshman for FP, so the programming assignments did give me a little challenge. I guess when one gots so fixed in the mindsets of imperative and objective programming, the adaptation to FP can be rough. I'm gonna finish the whole specialization, as they're all free for now : )
</ul>

### Functional Program Design in Scala

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a>

<li>Time: May 25, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: functional reactive programming, Scala
<li>Review: Relatively short.
</ul>

### Discrete Optimization

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/">University of Melbourne</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization">Discrete Optimization | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: July 5, 2017
<li>Grade: 93/100
<li>Topic: combinatorial optimization, meta-heuristics, randomization
<li>Review: Very challenging course which requires solid programming skill and lots of paper reading. Given the hands-on experience related to optimization techniques, it's totally worth all the time and efforts.
</ul>

### Parallel Programming

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1">Parallel Programming | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: July 18, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: scala programming, parallel computing, functional programming
<li>Review: Third course of the specialization, relatively short and easy. The last pogramming assignment is fun, which is an N-body simulation problem.
</ul>

### Game Theory

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>, <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">The University of British Columbia</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1/">Game Theory | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: August 02, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: game theory
<li>Review: Introduction to introduction to game theory, all quiz no code.
</ul>

### Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data/">Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: August 12, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: scala programming, parallel computing, spark programming
<li>Review: Fourth course of the specialization, relatively short and easy. The programming assignments took me a whole lot of time putting the APIs right. It's something you have to go through when learning a computation framework, no way around. Besides, the lecturer talks rather fast, with 1.5x play speed and no caption, I had the opportunity to practice my listening skill, that's the real fun.
</ul>

### Introduction to Data Science in Python

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/">Introduction to Data Science in Python | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: August 30, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: python programming, pandas, data science
<li>Review: An introductory course in ipython and pandas. The interactive notebook called "Jupyter" has nice user experience. If you're looking to learn some pandas programming, try it out.
</ul>

### Functional Programming in Scala Capstone

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-capstone/">Functional Programming in Scala Capstone | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: September 3, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: scala programming, parallel computing, data visualization, spark programming
<li>Review: Fifth course of the specialization, a step-by-step guide to a full scale project. The programming is challenging, while not at maths and algorithm, but at parallel programming, memorization, functional programming, all sorts of tweaking to make your code faster and tighter. The grader has a pretty tight memory limit of 1.5GB, which turned out to be a real headache, for you can experience failures randomly, making the programming assignment unnecessarily much harder. Still, every bit of effort pays off. Try it and see for yourself.
</ul>

### Microeconomics Principles

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/microeconomics/">Microeconomics Principles | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: September 23, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: microeconomics
<li>Review: An introductory course in microeconomics. I guess this is course 101 for economics major.
</ul>

### Model Thinking

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking/">Model Thinking | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: October 13, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: social science
<li>Review: An introductory course in social sciences. It's totally for high school students and undergraduate freshmen, with no rigorous math or hands-on case study projects. I guess I'm too old for this.
</ul>

### Introduction to Programming with MATLAB

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/">Vanderbilt University</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab/">Introduction to Programming with MATLAB | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: October 18, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: matlab programming
<li>Review: An introductory course in matlab programming. I skipped the videos and went for the programming assignments directly. It's just some exercises to avoid getting all rusty.
</ul>

### Applied Machine Learning in Python

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning/">Applied Machine Learning in Python | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: October 23, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: machine learning, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
<li>Review: A very well-designed course, teach you to do machine learning by calling all sorts of APIs. Actually, for small to middle-sized datasets, I think this kind of approach is quite handy, or shall we say, "lightweight". For extremely large datasets, small samples can be analyzed with toolkits like this to help make some sense, before we embark on deep learning and system-level optimizations.
</ul>

### Applied Text Mining in Python

<li>Topic: text mining, nltk, gensim
<li>Review: A brief introduction on text mining, with a few exercises in python.
</ul>
