My lab works on Coursera, all secured with passwords.

Coursera has an honor code, requesting that you should never make any content of your homework publicly available.
So I'd lock mines up with passwords in archives.

It's for backup, not sharing.

## Finished Courses

### Algorithms Part I

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/">Princeton University</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome">Algorithms, Part I | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: Apr 2, 2017
<li>Grade: 98.6/100
<li>Topic: ata structure, algorithm, Java
<li>Review: The lecture speed was <b>a bit too slow</b>, so I had to go at between 1.25x and 1.5x speed to save time. Everything is really well explained, making this course <b>very friendly even for fresh beginners</b>. Actually I signed up for this just to do a little practice in Java programming. Considering the ammount of work devoted to the programming assignments, it was a wise decision to join up, well worth the time and efforts.
</ul>

### Machine Learning

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome">Machine Learning | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: Apr 29, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: machine learning, Matlab
<li>Review: This is one of the "founding courses" of Coursera, thus it is supposed to be <b>easy and interesting</b> (otherwise people would've been scared off in the first place). So it is vital, for every programming assignment, that you try to <b>read and understand the 99% of codes already written for you</b>. The 1% for you to finish is really the trivial part. Otherwise there'll be no gain at all. Also it's fresh experience for those who get to <b>think in a vectorized manner</b> for the first time.

### Functional Programming Principles in Scala

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/home/welcome">Functional Programming Principles in Scala | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: May 10, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: functional programming, Scala
<li>Review: A course to learn Scala as well as functional programming. I'm a freshman for FP, so the programming assignments did give me a little challenge. I guess when one gots so fixed in the mindsets of imperative and objective programming, the adaptation to FP can be rough. I'm gonna finish the whole specialization, as they're all free for now : )
</ul>

### Functional Program Design in Scala

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2/home/welcome">Functional Program Design in Scala | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: May 25, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: functional reactive programming, Scala
<li>Review: Relatively short.
</ul>

### Discrete Optimization

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/">University of Melbourne</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization">Discrete Optimization | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: July 5, 2017
<li>Grade: 93/100
<li>Topic: combinatorial optimization, meta-heuristics, randomization
<li>Review: Very challenging course which requires solid programming skill and lots of paper reading. Given the hands-on experience related to optimization techniques, it's totally worth all the time and efforts.
</ul>

### Parallel Programming

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1">Parallel Programming | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: July 18, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: scala programming, parallel computing, functional programming
<li>Review: Third course of the specialization, relatively short and easy. The last pogramming assignment is fun, which is an N-body simulation problem.
</ul>

### Game Theory

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>, <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">The University of British Columbia</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1/">Game Theory | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: August 02, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: game theory
<li>Review: Introduction to introduction to game theory, all quiz no code.
</ul>

### Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data/">Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: August 12, 2017
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: scala programming, parallel computing, spark programming
<li>Review: Fourth course of the specialization, relatively short and easy. The programming assignments took me a whole lot of time putting the APIs right. It's something you have to go through when learning a computation framework, no way around. Besides, the lecturer talks rather fast, with 1.5x play speed and no caption, I had the opportunity to practice my listening skill, that's the real fun.
</ul>
