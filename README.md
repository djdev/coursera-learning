My lab works on Coursera, all secured with passwords.

Coursera has an honor code, requesting that you should never make any content of your homework publicly available.
So I lock mines up with passwords in archives.

It's just for the sake of preservation, not sharing.

## Finished Courses

### Algorithms Part I

<ul>
<li>Organization: [Princeton University](http://www.princeton.edu/main/)
<li>URL: [Algorithms, Part I | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome)
<li>Grade: 98.6/100
<li>Topic: ata structure, algorithm, Java
<li>Review: The lecture speed was <b>a bit too slow</b>, so I had to go at between 1.25x and 1.5x speed to save time. Everything is really well explained, making this course <b>very friendly even for fresh beginners</b>. Actually I signed up for this just to do a little practice in Java programming. Considering the ammount of work devoted to the programming assignments, it was a wise decision to join up, well worth the time and efforts.
</ul>

### Machine Learning

<ul>
<li>Organization: [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu/)
<li>URL: [Machine Learning | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: machine learning, Matlab
<li>Review: This is one of the "founding courses" of Coursera, thus it is supposed to be <b>easy and interesting</b> (otherwise people would've been scared off in the first place). So it is vital, for every programming assignment, that you try to <b>read and understand the 99% of codes already written for you</b>. The 1% for you to finish is really the trivial part. Otherwise there'll be no gain at all. Also it's fresh experience for those who get to <b>think in a vectorized manner</b> for the first time.
</ul>

### Functional Programming Principles in Scala

<ul>
<li>Organization: [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/)
<li>URL: [Functional Programming Principles in Scala | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/home/welcome)
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: functional programming, Scala
<li>Review: A course to learn Scala as well as functional programming. I'm a freshman for FP, so the programming assignments did give me a little challenge. I guess when one gots so fixed in the mindsets of imperative and objective programming, the adaptation to FP can be rough. I'm gonna finish the whole specialization, as they're all free for now : )
